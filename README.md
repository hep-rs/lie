# `lie-rs`

`lie-rs` provides functionalities to manipulate Lie groups and their
representations, including the ability to:

- Quickly verify whether a product of irreducible representations can form a
  singlet;
- Decompose the product of irreducible representation into sum of irreducible
  representations;
- List how indices of a product of irreducible representations can be contracted
  to form a singlet; and
- Other tools to manipulate root systems and Cartan matrices.

**This library is still undergoing development.**
